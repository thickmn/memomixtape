The electric vehicle company also warned that vehicle volume growth in 2024 'may be notably lower' than last year’s growth rate. Automotive revenue, meanwhile, increased just 1% from a year earlier, partly because the EVs were selling for less than they had in the past. Tesla implemented steep price cuts in the second half of the year around the world. In a Wednesday presentation, the company warned investors that it’s 'currently between two major growth waves.'",

Francl, a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, defended her seemingly radical idea to CNN affiliate ITV News, claiming: “It turns out that a tiny amount of salt, not enough to even taste, blocks the perception of bitterness.”  As transatlantic tensions reached a boiling point, the US Embassy in the UK intervened to distance themselves from the seemingly extremist idea, dunking the professor back into hot water.  “We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our Special Relationship,” the embassy wrote in a viral X post.  “We want to ensure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain’s national drink is not official Unites States policy. And never will be,” it added.  Francl also found little sympathy in the British press, which took her suggestion with more than a pinch of salt.",

Just last week, Microsoft took Apple’s spot as the most valuable publicly traded company, after trailing behind the iPhone maker for the better part of the last decade. Microsoft’s stock climb is due largely to its early and sweeping bets on generative artificial intelligence, an area in which Apple has largely remained mum.",
