On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the Biden transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition. Two days after becoming the projected winner of the 2020 election, Biden announced the formation of a task force to advise him on the COVID-19 pandemic during the transition, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, and Yale University's Marcella Nunez-Smith. On January 5, 2021, the Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate, effective January 20, as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term. President-elect Biden had supported and campaigned for both candidates prior to the runoff elections on January 5.On January 6, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol in the hope of overturning Biden's election, forcing Congress to evacuate during the counting of the Electoral College votes.

The 18-year-old has penned a contract with the Premier League champions until June 2028 but will remain at River Plate until next January before moving to City.  Echeverri, who sources told ESPN had also received interest from Barcelona, captained Argentina at the under 17 World Cup last year and starred in their run to the semfinals, where they lost on penalties to Germany.  He scored five goals in the U17 World Cup, including a hat trick against Brazil in the quarterfinal, and picked up the Bronze Ball prize as the tournament's third highest scorer.  River handed Echeverri his first team debut in June last year and he made an immediate impact, providing an assist in a 3-1 win over Instituto. He has made six first-team appearances in total for the Argentine giants.  The deal City have agreed for Echeverri is similar to the arrangement that eventually brought Julián Álvarez to the Etihad.",

   "context": "It only took eight years, but apparently Jon Stewart has finally decided to answer the plea from my May 2016 CNN article titled, 'We need Jon Stewart back now!'  At the time, my point was that we desperately needed Stewart back in “The Daily Show” host chair because he was the comedic antidote to then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. And after Trump won that election, many — including myself — believed that if only Stewart had not abdicated his late-night show in August 2015, Trump might well have been defeated.  That is why the news that Stewart is returning to “The Daily Show” in February as an executive producer and a host — even if just one day a week in that latter role — is more than the “Moment of Zen” he treated us to on his show for 16 years. It’s truly a moment of celebration.",

   "context": "DeepMind, the UK-based AI lab owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, has developed an AI system called AlphaGeometry that can solve complex geometry problems close to human Olympiad gold medalists. In a new paper in Nature, DeepMind revealed that AlphaGeometry was able to solve 25 out of 30 benchmark geometry problems from past International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) competitions within the standard time limits. This nearly matches the average score of 26 problems solved by human gold medalists on the same tests.  The AI system combines a neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine, providing a synergy that enables the system to find solutions to complex geometry theorems.  AlphaGeometry took a revolutionary approach to synthetic data generation by creating one billion random diagrams of geometric objects and deriving relationships between points and lines in each diagram. This process – termed “symbolic deduction and traceback” – resulted in a final training dataset of 100 million unique examples, providing a rich source for training the AI system.",

Perhaps it’s no wonder, then, that media company Time Out has named New York City as its best city for 2024.  Time Out surveyed some 20,000 city-dwellers across the world, alongside its network of global writers and editors, to compile its latest round-up of the best cities in the globe.  New York City’s myriad of museums and its thriving theater scene were namechecked by Time Out as reasons why the US city clinched the top spot. NYC’s global reputation also played a role – the city was ranked as the place other global city-dwellers would most like to relocate to.  At number two on Time Out’s list is Cape Town, South Africa, a city ranked, according to Time Out, by 'every single survey respondent' as “beautiful,” thanks no doubt to its stunning combination of sea, cityscape and spectacular mountainous surroundings.  Time Out specifically shouted out Cape Town’s cultural offerings – from its late night museum evenings over the summer months to its theater and comedy offerings at Theatre on the Bay, as well as the newly opened Time Out Market Cape Town.",
