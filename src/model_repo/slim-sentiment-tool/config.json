And never will be,” it added.  Francl also found little sympathy in the British press, which took her suggestion with more than a pinch of salt.",

The statement said that Princess Kate would remain hospitalized for “10 to 14 days, before returning home to continue her recovery” and that it would be unlikely for her to “return to public duties until after Easter.”",
