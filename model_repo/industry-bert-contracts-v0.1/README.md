<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

industry-bert-contracts-v0.1 is part of a series of industry-fine-tuned sentence_transformer embedding models.   

## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

industry-bert-contracts-v0.1 is a domain fine-tuned BERT-based 768-parameter Sentence Transformer model, intended to as a "drop-in" 
substitute for contractual and legal domains.   This model was trained on a wide range of publicly available commercial contracts, 
including open source contract datasets. 

- **Developed by:** llmware
- **Model type:** BERT-based Industry domain fine-tuned Sentence Transformer architecture
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** BERT-based model, fine-tuning methodology described below.

## Model Use

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("llmware/industry-bert-contracts-v0.1")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("llmware/industry-bert-contracts-v0.1")


## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

This is a semantic embedding model, fine-tuned on public domain contracts and related documents.   Results may vary if used outside of this
domain, and like any embedding model, there is always the potential for anomalies in the vector embedding space.   No specific safeguards have
put in place for safety or mitigate potential bias in the dataset.

### Training Procedure 

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

This model was fine-tuned using a custom self-supervised procedure and custom dataset that combined contrastive techniques 
with stochastic injections of distortions in the samples.  The methodology was derived, adapted and inspired primarily from 
three research papers cited below:  TSDAE (Reimers), DeClutr (Giorgi), and Contrastive Tension (Carlsson).
