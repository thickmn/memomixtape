The 18-year-old has penned a contract with the Premier League champions until June 2028 but will remain at River Plate until next January before moving to City.  Echeverri, who sources told ESPN had also received interest from Barcelona, captained Argentina at the under 17 World Cup last year and starred in their run to the semfinals, where they lost on penalties to Germany.  He scored five goals in the U17 World Cup, including a hat trick against Brazil in the quarterfinal, and picked up the Bronze Ball prize as the tournament's third highest scorer.  River handed Echeverri his first team debut in June last year and he made an immediate impact, providing an assist in a 3-1 win over Instituto. He has made six first-team appearances in total for the Argentine giants.

At the time, my point was that we desperately needed Stewart back in “The Daily Show” host chair because he was the comedic antidote to then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. And after Trump won that election, many — including myself — believed that if only Stewart had not abdicated his late-night show in August 2015, Trump might well have been defeated.  That is why the news that Stewart is returning to “The Daily Show” in February as an executive producer and a host — even if just one day a week in that latter role — is more than the “Moment of Zen” he treated us to on his show for 16 years.

   "context": "DeepMind, the UK-based AI lab owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, has developed an AI system called AlphaGeometry that can solve complex geometry problems close to human Olympiad gold medalists. In a new paper in Nature, DeepMind revealed that AlphaGeometry was able to solve 25 out of 30 benchmark geometry problems from past International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) competitions within the standard time limits. This nearly matches the average score of 26 problems solved by human gold medalists on the same tests.  The AI system combines a neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine, providing a synergy that enables the system to find solutions to complex geometry theorems.  AlphaGeometry took a revolutionary approach to synthetic data generation by creating one billion random diagrams of geometric objects and deriving relationships between points and lines in each diagram. This process – termed “symbolic deduction and traceback” – resulted in a final training dataset of 100 million unique examples, providing a rich source for training the AI system.",
